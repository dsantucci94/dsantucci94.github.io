              <p2> For the website, we wanted to Monkeybars was developed with the idea of unplugging from technology and getting back to your roots as a company. Our brand included a typeface inspired by the pure geometry from jungle bars. For marketing, I designed a posters series highlighting one letter from our typeface. We also used our typeface for wayfinding projections outside.

                <h5>The Design Process</h5>
                <p2>For our website we wanted to focus on signing up before the conference and then after the conference promoting next years. In order to stay on brand with unplugging, we created the website with minimal navigational bars. Simplicity was the main goal. We made both a desktop and mobile version of the website.
