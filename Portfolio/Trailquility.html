              <h5>The Website</h5>
              <p2> In order to learn more about the conference and purchase a ticket, we created a wesbite. In order to reflect the idea of unplugging from technology, we designed the website with a minimal dropdown navigation bar on top. The website is divived in four sections-the concept, the workshops, the speakers, and the conference schedule. Each section includes a call out to buy tickets. Since Monkeybars is focused on unplugging we wanted the website to just provide the most important information in the most simplistic way.

                <h5>Branding & Marketing</h5>
                <p2> The Monkeybars conference is targeted towards start-up tech companies who want to learn how to not climb the ladder of success but rather reach out for it. In order to portray this, we created our own typeface inspired by the pure geometry from jungle bars. For marketing collaterol, we designed a poster series highlighting a different letter from our typeface. We also used our typeface throughout the conference including our welcome bags, our wayfinding projections outside, and for our mobile application.

                <h5>The Design Process</h5>
                <p2>Once we decided on the brand identity, we went through rounds of sketches for the Monkeybars website before the conference. We needed to make it both web and mobile responsive. We also had to redesign the website while the conference was going on and once it finished. We wanted to the website during the conference to give updates on speakers and workshops for people who weren't able to attend the conference. Once the conference was over, we wanted the website to still include the top navigation bar with the four sections but with highlights from the conference. After rounds of sketching, we were able to make the final prototype.

        <h5>The Mobile Application</h5>
        <p2> The Monkeybars mobile application has two phases. The first phase is during the conference. Although Monkeybars encourages unplugging, we wanted the app to only be used for conference information for guests. The user will have there own profile and be able to view a map of the camp ground and a detailed schedule of the conference. The second phase of the app is focused on unplugging. We wanted guests to be able to leave the conference and still practice unplugging. Our app is gives the user an option to either do a ten minute breathing excerise or do a suggested activity that requires unplugging. In order to encourage users to attend next year's conference, we provided an achievements section on the user profile that gives away freebies and deals if the user unplugs a certain amount of times.
